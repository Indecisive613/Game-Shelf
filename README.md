# Game Shelf

## Overview
Game Shelf is a website that helps users keep track of their board game collection. Users add games to a virtual board game shelf, then search their shelf using various criteria such as game category, creator, and player count to find specific games. Users can choose how they want the results to be displayed: alphabetically, by complexity, by game length, or by popularity. The site also includes a game library containing board games from all users, which can be browsed or searched to discover new games that suit a userâ€™s tastes. Finally, the friends feature allows users to see the games of others. This can be used as another game recommendation tool, or if the users know each other in person, this can help determine which games they should play together.

## Languages
