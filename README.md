# Game Shelf

## Overview
Game Shelf is a website that helps users keep track of their board game collection. Users add games to a virtual board game shelf, then search their shelf using various criteria such as game category, creator, and player count to find specific games. Users can choose how they want the results to be displayed: alphabetically, by complexity, by game length, or by popularity. The site also includes a game library containing board games from all users, which can be browsed or searched to discover new games that suit a userâ€™s tastes. Finally, the friends feature allows users to see the games of others. This can be used as another game recommendation tool, or if the users know each other in person, this can help determine which games they should play together.

## Languages  
This project uses HTML, CSS, PHP and SQL. Since Github only allows for static sites, a working product is not available. Instead, please see the detailed description which contains screenshots of the site.

In "My Shelf" a user can add a game to their shelf by typing the name of the game into the textbox. If the game already exists, it will be added to the users shelf. If it is a new game, the user will be asked to fill out some information about the game. Checks are performed on the inputted information to ensure the information makes sense.

Search Games allows users to find specific games. First, users can choose a collection to search: their personal shelf, the game library, or a shelf of a friend. Next, they have the choice to input search criteria: game mechanism, keyword, creator, complexity, player count, length. Finally, they have the choice to choose how they wish results to be displayed: alphabetically, by popularity, by complexity, or by playing time.
