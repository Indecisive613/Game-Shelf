# Game Shelf

## Overview
Game Shelf is a website where users can keep track of their board game collection. Users add games to a virtual board game shelf, then search their collection using various criteria such as game category, creator, and player count to find specific games. Users can choose how they want the results to be displayed: alphabetically, by complexity, by game length, or by popularity. The site also includes a game library containing board games from all users, which can be searched to discover new games that suit a userâ€™s tastes. Finally, the friends feature allows users to see the games of others.

## Languages  
This project uses HTML, CSS, PHP and SQL. Since Github only allows for static sites, a working product is not available. Instead, please see the description which contains screenshots of the site.

## Description

In "My Shelf" => "Add Game", a user can add a game to their shelf by typing the name of the game into the textbox. If the game already exists, it will be added to the users shelf. If it is a new game, the user will be asked to fill out some information about the game. Checks are performed on the inputted data to ensure the information makes sense.

Next, they have the choice to input the following search criteria: game mechanism, keyword, creator, complexity, player count, length. Finally, they have the choice to choose how they wish results to be displayed: alphabetically, by popularity, by complexity, or by playing time.
